# NeuralNetwork_wNumPy
This Python code implements a neural network from scratch with dense layers, ReLU &amp; softmax activations, and SGD, Adagrad, RMSprop &amp; Adam optimizers. Trains on a synthetic spiral dataset for classification. A learning resource for understanding neural network fundamentals.
PS : Used sentdex's guide and tutorial to grasp Neural Networks mathamatical and code intutions thus a big shoutout to him and his team
